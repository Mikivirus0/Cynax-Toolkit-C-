Project: Cynax Toolkit

Preface:
Cynax Toolkit is basically a set of different classes, that collectively perform the function of toolkit. These functions include
•	A login function (To Achieve CIA).
•	A Cypher function that performs (Encryption & Decryption).
•	A Hash function (That calculates Hash of a message).
•	Strong Password Generator (Creates a Random Strong Password, as per users’ needs).
•	A firewall function (That Blocks or unblocks websites using file handling and file directory).
Basic Idea for making such a program was, as students of CYS, we ought to implement the knowledge and skills of programming to make a relative program, and there we got the Idea of the toolkit. And as explained earlier, the functionality of program is not very complex, but it shows a strong relation to Cyber Security.
Interface:
The Interface of program is very simple, yet understanding and attractive, achieved using simple Do-While and If-else statements. The UI on the other hand is made using simple cout statements with the help of tab spaces and new line shortcuts. Interactive UI is the fundamental of a good program, and here we’ve achieved that using very simple and straight forward logic.

Program Functionality:
The concept of hierarchical inheritance is strongly influenced and used in our login/security function as its parameters are inherited in the remaining classes except in our Info class. 
The info class has been made using aggregation to provide independency for the program so that it can run without it if need be. 
1.	SECURITY CLASS:
We have used different if/else statements to authenticate the user. That perform the task of a security gate and limitize the access of the program to unauthenticated persons. This function of program achieve 3rd pillar of cyber security that is “Availability”. Only We admins can use this program, as we haven’t added any other acceptance of password rather then our.
2.	Tools Class :
Tools class, contains tools of our program and this is most important class of our program because we have made our tools in the functions of this class and this adds life to our program. 
3.	Info Class : 
In this class we have added the information about the owners of this class, Relation of this class with toolkit is Aggregation.
